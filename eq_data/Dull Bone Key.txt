ITEM NAME: Dull Bone Key



Dull Bone Key


MAGIC ITEM
WT: 0.1  Size: TINY
Class: ALL
Race: ALL


This key is necessary to open the second door to Rathyl, once you are in the room in the basement which requires the Shiny Metal Key (off of the Ogre Guard Captain - I believe). Oddly enough, the Dull Bone and the Bloodstained keys both also drop off of the Magicians in the Shiny Metal key room. 
Other keys in Najena: Guard's Keyring and Golden Crescent Key.
