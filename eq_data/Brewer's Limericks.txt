  Book contents 
Some of Norrath's imbibers put together a compilation of their favorite limericks.
If you look closely you can almost tell how to put together the drinks they enjoy with each one.
Here are a few to start.

When Ssra goes to move barley
He meets a girl named Darley
To the cask in the vault
He adds hops and malt
And drinks till her face
isn't gnarly

With hops malt and Yeast
An ogre made mead for a feast
when his cask they did fill
not a drop did he spill
So they cheered the ugly
beast

My good friend where is my
cask?
Is the water too much to ask?
Deliver barley and hops
With the rest of my crops
Or your death will be my next
task!

Ogre's lust for a wench named
Sulock
For a date bring a cask and
Froglok
Malt and yeast to the barber
Get them near her harbor
And you'll hear an uproar
if they dock
