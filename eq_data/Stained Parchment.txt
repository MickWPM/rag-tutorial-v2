  Book contents 
In the mirror of this wretched society, we await. . .the time grows ever near, for us to shatter these rose-colored visions of Ak'Anon's citizens, and let their eyes fall upon the image of our true selves.  The Dark Reflection readies its soldiers of Bertoxxulous, hidden away deep beneath Ak'Anon, in the Mines of Malfunction.  Naygog Mitope is your new master now. . .do not keep him waiting.
