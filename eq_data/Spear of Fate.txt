ITEM NAME: Spear of Fate

Epic Quests Era (added Sept 2000)
 Spear of Fate wielded by an Ogre Shaman. The Curse of the Spirits is a magic based damage over time spell that starts off weak, but gradually increases in damage towards the end of the spell's duration. This is why it draws little or no aggro when you cast it. It does a total of about 1425 HP damage over a course of 1.5 minutes.
