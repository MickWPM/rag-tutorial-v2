  Book contents 
A time now past /
Our steps bloomed glory /
Lead by the Chosen /
Protected by their Guard /
The hidden lord spoke /
His words we did hear /
With his knowledge we struck forth /
Purpose in our hearts
A pact was drawn /
War and Fear intertwined /
Angels descended /
Harbingers of a blessing /
A brood was brought forth /
Two eggs /
Two brothers /
Raised by the angels /
The Guard of the High Scale
Generations passed /
And Angels did raise /
Two eggs /
Two brothers /
Ever vigilant in their duty /
When chosen strikes forth /
Under boon of our lord /
The brothers hold the flanks /
A pact is held true
Time conquers all /
None can withstand /
Not stone /
Not flesh /
Not mind /
Not pact /
The thread that binds /
Withers and frays /
As centuries pass /
The flanks left exposed
Battle did come /
And Chosen moved with purpose /
Their lances locked forward /
The brothers at the flanks /
Yet pact now broken /
The Guard sought glory /
When spear came to bear /
Shouts were heard /
?The Guard! The Pact! Our /
Chosen is slain!? /
Vanity? /
A spear head? /
Our lord cared not for the damage was done
The Brothers then fled /
From death /
From shame /
From blade of sword /
A duty now lost /
Blood of a Chosen /
Staining their hands /
Brothers now abandoned by the angels of Fear /
The land they did walk /
Their only possession /
The pact now broken /
A Queen then appeared /
With promise of redemption /
Her words laced with lies /
Fell upon deaf ears / 
Their desperation the wound /
A Queen?s promise the poison /
A new pact was drawn
The brothers now fallen /
Guards yet again /
Not of Chosen /
Not of Angels /
Only sorrow and contempt /
The wardens of shame /
Two eggs /
Two brothers /
A curse now to bear
