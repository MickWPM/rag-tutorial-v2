This charged item is useful for pullers to remove annoying NPC buffs such as Spirit of Wolf or damage shields. It generates less aggro than Wooly Spider Silk Net or Midnight Mallet. It can also be used on self to remove dangerous debuffs such as root, snare, or DoTs. 
Buyback from a vendor is ~2000 platinum each.
8/2020: Casting time is no longer instant. About 1.5 seconds. This may have happened when the recharge cost was increased to 2000 plat but cannot say for certain.
