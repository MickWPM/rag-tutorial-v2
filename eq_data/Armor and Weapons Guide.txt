ON SIZING AND ARMOR
Some types of armor must be sized to your client. There are three sizes of armor:
Small, medium and large. Some races can wear more than one size of armor.
Barbarians, ogres and trolls wear large armor.
Barbarians, elves, Erudites, half-elves and humans wear medium armor.
Dwarves, elves, gnomes and halflings wear small armor.
BANDED ARMOR (SMALL, MEDIUM & LARGE)
Each piece of banded armor can be sized to a small, medium or large client.
The size of the armor is determined by the mold used.
Each section of banded armor requires a sheet of metal and a mold appropriate to
that section of the body. Each also requires a flask of water to cool it.
Belts, cloaks, helms, masks, mantles, and sleeves require 2 sheets of metal.
Leggings, and mail require 3 sheets of metal.
