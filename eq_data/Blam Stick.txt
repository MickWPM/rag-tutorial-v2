Telin added this as a rare drop as per [1], 4/7/19 officially in game. "Effect" is intentionally blank, but has a graphical fireball effect (harmless).[2]
After some testing on green, it seems like this is less than 5% chance to drop. Very rare, not rare/uncommon as hoped. 1 blam stick out of 20 kills, then 35+ kills still no blam stick. So 1 stick in 55 kills and still waiting on another to drop.
