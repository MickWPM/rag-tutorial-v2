ITEM NAME: Glowing Worm Bile

Glowing Worm Bile


MAGIC ITEM  NO DROP
WT: 1.0  Size: MEDIUM
Class: ALL
Race: ALL


Confirmed drop off a young shardwurm outside of the cave, can drop up to two at once. The shardwurm will emit a glow at night if they are carrying the Glowing Worm Bile (shown in the left image below). The glow is also faintly visible during the day. The drops are about ~5% so you'll want to end up killing all shardwurms anyways to farm this efficiently.
