Stackable. These are the longest range stackable monk throwing weapons, however they are difficult to mass manufacture because temper required is sold in Thurgadin while molds are sold in other cities. They are also expensive, being over 4pp per jav in costs from temper alone.  A blacksmith should consider making the Forged Javelin instead, which is far more efficient.
