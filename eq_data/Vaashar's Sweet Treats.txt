Lizard on a Stick
It is almost as fun watching the skin shrivel on these stringy little critters while they cook as it is catching them!
Ingredients: Lizard meat, Spices, and Jug of Sauces, Skewers
Cooking Instructions: Fire a spit for high heat. Gently impale whole lizard onto skewer and
season with spices and sauces. Carefully char and blacken without breaking the legs off.
Tastes great with: Meat Pie and Ale
Pickled Froglok
Many are afraid to eat froglok but once tried all say it "tastes just like gator". Pickling
helps enhance the natural latent flavors in the meat.
Ingredients: Froglok, Vinegar, 1 Jar
Cooking Instructions: Dump froglok chunklets into a jar. Add enough vinegar to cover froglok.
Allow to ripen in the sun until vinegar turns a seafoam green color.
Tastes great with: Gator Steaks and Bog Juice
Beer Braised Gator
Don't let the slime green color fool you - Gator is as hot as vindaloo. This
rubbery meat globs up when cooked, extending the chewing time enough to burn your taste buds.
Ingredients: Gator Meat, Spices, Short Beer
Cooking instructions: Fire a spit or oven, and place a pan underneath to catch falling globs.
Season and marinate in beer until foamy, then grill. Larger clumps are saved for honored guests.
Tastes great with: Fish Head Soup and Short Beer
Batwing Crunchies
Gnawing on these tasty treats helps blacken the teeth and build jaws of monstrous proportions.
When you've finished chewing the webbing, use the bones to pick your teeth. The perfect snack!
Ingredients: Batwings and Frosting
Cooking Instructions: Fire oven for low heat. Smother batwings in frosting and place in oven.
Remove when hardened and frosting crystallizes.
Tastes great with: Wolf Steaks and Ale
The end.
