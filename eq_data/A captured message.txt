  Book contents 
Master Druushk, Several visions have come to me in my sleep over the past week. These dreams could not have been of my own creation. There is some force moving around me that I cannot identify. I fear that this presence will make itself known soon. I must assume at this time that Korucust is working to expose me. Perhaps he has gained some understanding of my true nature. I do not know why he would play these games rather than just expose me to the council. Loyal servant of the Ring, Vrasyk
