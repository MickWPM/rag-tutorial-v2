recipe can even be made by a Troll (or out of Troll if you prefer).
Ingredients: Clump of Dough, Chunk of Meat, Spices, 1 Pie Tin
Cooking Instructions: For crust, line the bottom of a pie tin with a clump
of dough. Mix a chunk of meat with spices and plop onto the crust. Decorate
top with extra dough. Bake at high heat until juices ooze out the sides.
Tastes great with: Rat Ear Crunchies and Ale

Cupcakes
Lumpy, bumpy and delicious. Cupcakes were originally created by a clumsy traveler who
dropped his last clump of dough into some frosting.
Ingredients: Clump of Dough, Spices, Frosting, 1 Muffin Tin

at medium heat until gray and lumps begin to rise. Allow to cool, then dunk tops in frosting and eat.

Vegetable Pie
