Rechargeable for 25p, you can recharge these yourself without switching characters or relying on a friend because it isn't LORE. Weighs less and has two more charges over a Cloudy Potion. Though it has fewer charges than Larrikan's Mask,  you can also recharge a Larri mask yourself with a box of the void and a class 3 mana battery. 
The recharge rate for this item was not affected by the April 2020 nerf.
