  Book contents 
Seafarer Ringmail Seafarer ringmail is the choice armor of all wise seamen. 
Flexible enough not to hinder your motions and light enough not to drag you 
down to the briny deep should you happen to walk the plank. Each piece of 
Seafarer ringmail is constructed in the unique Freeport Forge of medium 
quality rings, forged with a smithy hammer, tempered with Sea Temper, and 
patterned onto a piece of leather armor.
