GUIDE TO POTTERY
Pottery is the art of making containers and other useful items from earth, water and fire.
Before you under take your work as a potter, you will need a Pottery Wheel and a Kiln. Both can be found in most cities.
Place your raw materials on the pottery wheel. Once you have your product, you will need to fire your work in the Kiln.
Note: You will ALWAYS need A Flask of Water to work with.
Once you have constructed your item, put it upon appropriate firing sheet and place in the Kiln.
