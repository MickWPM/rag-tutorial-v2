  Book contents 
Venril Sathir of the Kunzar
The greatest lizard to walk upon the land was Venril Sathir of the Kunzar Tribe. All that is known of his youth was that he was a member of the ancient Kunzar Tribe. This was during the time of division among the tribes of the Iksar. He was said never to have been a mere broodling. He was forever a master of combat.
Venril would soon slay his father and take his rightful place as chief of the Kunzar Tribe. He led the Kunzar on many expeditions into the ruins and wilds of Kunark. He sought knowledge and weapons. In his late youth he found the hidden library of the necromancer, Kotiz. He would come to open a large book which opened into a small room. Climbing into the book he found a floating book. The Unholy Writ of War was its title. Made of Iksar skins, it contained great knowledge of combat. Venril became the book's master.
Venril soon showed signs of dark knowledge. He began to wield the forces of the dark circle and his knowledge of combat tactics became supreme. He trained his army new tactics and even raised the bones of the fallen to fight yet again for their masters. His army grew and marched to all corners of Kunark. Venril Sathir's army is now unstoppable. He shall soon plot the union of the entire Iksar nation. He no longer wishes to be just Chief, but rather, Emnperor. Under his direction the four remaining tribe states of the Iksar shall unite and a new age shall dawn.
