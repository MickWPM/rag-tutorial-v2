The Note is rolled up.

Shaman, I have sent another of your ilk to retrieve the mandible which was taken from us. He will meet up with you at Bone Run around midnight. When you have them, find a way to get some Mendglow Clay and a wheel from Cabilis so we can mend this skull. I am enroute to find the Giant Barracuda who swallowed the other skull at the lake.
