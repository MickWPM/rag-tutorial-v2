This item has a similar effect to that of the Journeyman's Boots, the only difference being this item's 1.5 second cast time versus the Journeyman boots' instant cast time. Due to the vendor price of this item being over 5,000 platinum, it may be advisable to purchase a Journeyman's Boots multi-quest depending on current market value, as it is a strictly better item.
