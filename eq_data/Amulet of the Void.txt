Appears to be a post-upgrade version of Amulet of Planar Transference.
The Amulet of the Void can be recharged in a Box of the Void with a Mana Battery - Class Five both of which can be bought from the Key Master on the first Island for about 55 platinum.
Unlike the casted spell version of Alter Plane: Sky, this amulet is not usable in Plane of Sky.
This item is now usable in Plane of Sky with the chardok revamp patch.
Besides saving a guild money on sky raids, it's a great instant click panic button like a WC cap but cheaper to use and easier to recharge.
