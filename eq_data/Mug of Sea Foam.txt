MAGIC ITEM
WT: 0.1  Size: SMALL
Class: ALL
Race: ALL


Had one drop from one of the isle goblins at Oracle island, I forget which goblin though. (note: Not confirmed if this is obtained from fishing. I fished up 12 Saltwater Seaweeds and have fished up 0 Mug of Sea Foam) This can be fished in Ocean of Tears and in Butcherblock. You get about one seaweed per stack of bait.
