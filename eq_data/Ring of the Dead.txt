This item, like the Locket of Escape, with the ability to bind melee, was viewed as game altering, and changed several times on live.
It flipped between NO DROP and not, as well as Must Equip to Any Slot (usable by all classes). See this thread for more details.
Currently NO DROP on p99 as of the 2/17/13 patch.
