This excellent two-hander is prized by tanks for its reasonable ratio, lure proc, and excellent stats as a good defense against enemies with dangerous procs or rampages such as Venril Sathir, a dracoliche and Maestro of Rancor. In this role, few other two-handers are better, such as Gaudralek, Sword of the Sky and Palladius` Axe of Slaughter.
