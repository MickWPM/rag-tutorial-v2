  Book contents 
BOWYERS GUIDE - FIFTH EDITION
The art of the Bowyer, the maker of bows, is as ancient as the oldest of elves. This
tome details the construction of bows, as well as providing information on the sister
craft of Fletching.
Bowyers and Fletchers both require a Fletching Kit to practice their trades.
Fletching kits can be purchased from archery shops.
BOWS
There are four components to every bow.
TOOLS
The use of tools, while not necessary in the construction of a bow, helps to produce a premium product. A whittling
blade will increase the	quality of your bow. A planing tool is superior to a whittling blade.
STRING
The most commonly used string is hemp twine. One step above hemp is linen string.
Only the best bows are strung with silk.
CAMS
Most bows are not built with Cams. Composite bows use a series of one or two Cams.
LUMBER
The material that the bow is constructed from is directly proportional to the performance of the bow.
List of wood, in order of difficulty and quality.
