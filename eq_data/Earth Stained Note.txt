  Book contents 
We cannot speak again. Our circle is now known and must seek sanctuary. In case this note were to fall into others' hands, I cannot tell you plainly the next steps of your task.
All I can say is to seek she who walks the path of the mother, she who walks the lands in service to her kin. Give her this note and she will know.
