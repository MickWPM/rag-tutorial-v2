  Book contents 
An Elementalist's power comes from the Orb of Mastery. The Elements of Earth, Fire, Wind and Water are contained
within the Orb. The Master of Elements holds the Orb.
He can be found within the Plane of Air. No mortal has been able contain the true power of the Orb.
Trilith Magi'kot presented himself to the Master of Elements and the Orb of Mastery. The power of
elements brought agony to his mind and body. Magi'kot was not of Balance.
Fire burned his eyes unto blindness, Wind put his mind into a spin, Earth entered his body and aged him like the
mountains,and finally, Water washed his memories of mortal life away.
Failing his test, the Orb exacted its terrible price, and now Magikot is part of the Orb.
The bearer of this tome should seek out the Master of Fire and present it to
him, for there is much left to be revealed.
