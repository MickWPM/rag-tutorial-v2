Guide to Blacksmithing
Blacksmithing is the art of creating tools from the primal elements of the earth - Ore, Water and Fire. Talented blacksmiths can create weapons, armor and other useful items.
Before you undertake your work as a smith, you will need a forge. Forges can be found in most cities. Place your raw materials upon the forge. Begin your work.
Conversion rates:

 Two pieces of Small Ore = Metal Bits
 Three Small Bricks of Ore = Large Brick of Ore
 Three Large Bricks of Ore = Block of Ore

You will need a flask of water to cool the ore.
