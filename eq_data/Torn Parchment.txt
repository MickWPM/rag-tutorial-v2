  Book contents 
Dear Merona, I wont be returning to you. You see, I have found my true calling as a disciple of Bertoxxulous.
I have become one of the Bloodsabers. I have foolishly given them my flesh.
I was a weakling and cried while they stripped it from my bones.
I only pray that you too will someday know the pain that I now endure as one of the undead.
Your pitiful and stupid dead brother, Ronn
