  Book contents 
Immortals
The immortals who can be spoken of are not the eternal immortals.
Their spoken names are not their eternal names. In namelessness they are the
beginning of heaven and earth. Named they are one with the ten thousand things.
Though different in title they spring from one source and appear as darkness.
Darkness within darkness. The gate to their mystery.
The immortals do not go forth. All comes to them. They are like the ocean, the
king of ten thousand streams. By staying beneath they are a receptacle for all things.
They do nothing. Yet are masters of the universe.
Trorsmang! Be our course of action.
Anbeal! Become the vessel to hold our virtue.
Drinal! Be our stability, where we can take root.
Cordan! Fill our vessel and calm our ambitions.
Norrath! Take our husks and breathe life into them.
We beseech you! Guide us in your humility.
The end.
