  Book contents 
THE WHEEL OF TARTON

TARTON HAD A WHEEL
THAT ONCE HE BUILT
TEN SPOKES TO WOOD
BOUND BY A STAR

TARTON HAD A WHEEL
TO ROAM THE PLANES
SHAPED TWICE BY ICE
TO GUIDE HIS WAY

TARTON HAD A WHEEL
THAT ONCE HE LOST
CLASH IN THE SKY
TO EARTH HE FELL

TARTON HAD A WHEEL
WAS SUNDERED PAST
THE PIECES SCATTERED
ACROSS THE WORLD

AZIA

In the crossing
Of the waters
Rests a ship
On its side

Drowned sailors
Swim around it
Past this ship
The Azia lies.

BEZA

In the land
Of wind and snow
This stream of water
Does not flow

Below the ice
Upon dry land
The Beza rests
Held by no hand

CAZA

In the Lake of Rathe
An island looms
It hides a treasure
In its womb

A stone tower
Protected sleeps
Those who guard it
Can not weep 

DENA

A cauldron stews
But does not boil
Its edges rock
Not dirt or soil

Inside the cauldron
Lurks a door
The Dena lies
Some paces score

ENA

Once Trolls did live
Within these halls
Then vengeance struck
Their might did fall

A well of water
Upside down
The Ena rests
Yet does not drown

FANA

The tears of Marr
A pool do make
Two towers stand
Within this lake

In one tower
Guarded high
The Fana dreams
Of sleeping dry

GEZA

Upon the mountain
Through the pass
The Tiger Roars
With eyes of glass

The Tiger sees
The waters fall
Geza is held
Under its thrall

HEDA

Under this city
Upon the coast
Tunnels stretch
And secrets boast

Two dark pits
Within the ground
Fins circle Heda
Round and round

IZAH

Under the Mountain
Where the sunless mass
The Blind Fish swims
With eyes of glass

The Blind Fish sees
Through azure haze
The Izah rests
Within its gaze

JAKA

Upon this house
Was laid a Doom
Its owners rise
From beyond the tomb

Now sunken is
A Dwarven crest
Where the Jaka lies
But can not rest

The end.
