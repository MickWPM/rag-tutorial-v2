  Book contents 
Dear, brother, I fear that my soul has been overtaken by a great evil. My sanity barely hangs on by a thread.
My dreams of the sweet red blood of others are soon to drive me mad.  The howls in the night call to me.
It is best for me to leave.  I pray that I can deliver this note before I go mad.
Please understand that it is better that I am never seen again.
Goodbye.  Keep up the fight for the forest folk.
