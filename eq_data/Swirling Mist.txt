ITEM NAME: Swirling Mist


Swirling Mist


MAGIC ITEM
WT: 0.1  Size: TINY
Class: ALL
Race: ALL


The best place to farm Swirling Mists is probably Najena. There are ten spots in Najena that seem to have a 50% chance to spawn a Mist Elemental. The elementals seem to have about a 25% drop rate, so it's reasonable to expect one Swirling Mist for each set of those ten elementals cleared. The respawn timer in Najena is twenty minutes, so three sets of spawns an hour means one will get about three swirling mists an hour. On average, of course, as sometimes the elementals won't drop anything for several hours in a row, and sometimes they'll drop three or four Swirling Mists back to back.
