This wand may be clicked at level 1 and recharged. The buyback price is 6pp per wand. A lesser known way to cheese and quad a spectre. Six or so wands per spectre quad, and the spectre drops may cover the recharge cost. Nerfed April 19th 2020 [1] 
The nerf was its value is zero meaning you can no longer sell to a vendor at all. Also now has casting time and no longer Instant.
