Molded Jewelry
This technique is the legacy of jewelcraft master
Srettib, who was able to draw upon the force of
mineral essence. His passion for working with
the rarest and most beautiful stones quickly led
him to concoct a firm setting to ensure the
precious stones would not be lost (as was often the
case with previous wire techniques). His artistic
genius not only led him to create molded settings,
but enabled him to convoke the latent magical powers
within stones and externalize them. He coupled stones with
various metals to control the outcome of the powers
he unleashed.
Every jewelcrafter learns Srettib's techniques, and
in homage to his memory, all other forms of
jewelcraft have been abandoned.
Jewelcraft Master Srettib's Instructions:
All jewelry carries a unique charm. Exquisite stones
placed in the finest crafted settings, are more
likely to release the force of mineral essence.
Try various combinations.
Combine any stone with any metal to create unique
jewelry. Precious stones are generally cut so that
they will reflect the most light. Other stones may be
tumbled for a smooth surface or left untumbled if they
have an interesting shape. Pearls and crystals are
generally left natural.
Use the molds in your jewelry kit and pour melted metal
into the mold, allow it to cool and remove the metal
from the mold.
To add cut stones, carve a pronged cup mold so that
the prongs are down and the base of the cup is at the
top.
Weld the base of the cup to the top of the ring,
bracelet, etc. Insert the stone into the cup and
carefully bend down the prongs to trap the stone.
To add odd-shaped untumbled stones, custom carve a mold
to fit the stone with the bottom of the cup at the bottom
of the mold. Pour a small amount of melted metal into
the mold and immediately insert the stone. Allow to
cool and remove from the mold.
