Fish Head Soup
This gooey gumbo uses only the choicest part of the fish. Nicknamed "Heads-up Soup" because of the old
fishermen's game of watching to see which head surfaces first!

Cooking Instructions: Remove heads from fish and drop into a pot of water. Add sauces and
boil without stirring. Remove from heat as soon as fish heads float to the top. Serve piping hot.
