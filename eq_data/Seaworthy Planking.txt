ITEM NAME: Seaworthy Planking

Velious Era (added December 2000-2001)
 NERF ALERT (see notes)

Seaworthy Planking


LORE ITEM  NO DROP
WT: 10.0  Size: GIANT
Class: ALL
Race: ALL


Iceclad Ocean ground spawn was removed on Blue (several months after Velious release?), but existing planks were not removed and are MQable.
On Green, one confirmed spawn location is (2500, -2952) which is approximately where it spawned on Blue in 2016. There may be other spawn locations, reportedly most spawns are on the icebergs east of cougar/gnome island. The respawn time doesn't seem to be instant, and could be several hours. 
The Titanium client has had bugs in the past where ground spawns do not display after being picked up by another player. Relogging can fix this if it occurs.
