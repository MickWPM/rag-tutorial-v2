  Book contents 
My Brethren,
Today we embark on a journey that will lead us past the boundaries of our known world.
It is by our choice that we make this journey, to discover new lands, and to make
a new home for ourselves. It is an honor to call you countrymen and friends. Let
us rejoice in our accomplishments as we take the lands of our pitiful
brothers, and show them the way of the true gnoll. Be well, my brothers, and may 
the gods guide your hands.
Ishva Verishe Val
Tesch Val,
you must recover, from the archives, the incantation to speed our transit to the new
continent. Let not one of the council members see you, or you will surely be slain.
You must complete this task I have laid before you, or they will eventually find us
and slay us. The accursed council knows of my location, so I must be off. Slay the
messenger of this note when you have finished reading it.
Good journey to you, my faithful.
Ishva Rosch Val,
our plans have failed. We must escape this continent or risk being slain by the
other elders on the council. My place upon the council was forfeit once it became known
that I practiced the dark magiks. We must quicken our search for the maps. If we
are unable to find the spell which will open the gate to Antonica, then we must
acquire another means of travel.
Ishva
Fear not my brethren! We have taken this home and we shall make it our own! Use
what resources we have to establish ourselves here. Care not about the Theth, for
they are our inferiors. Use their goods, use their services, and use their skins
if need be. In time, we shall feel our former glory!
Ishk kal hobra!
