Stackable. 18pp per stack. As of 9/6/2016, they are the longest range throwing weapon for monks that is stackable and easily crafted in large quantities, except for Antonian Javelins which only humans may craft but both races may use. Depending on Blacksmithing skill and luck, the cost of crafting these is about 11pp per stack. If a monk blacksmith is trying to cut down on weight and cost, the humble Forged Throwing Axe is a good compromise.
