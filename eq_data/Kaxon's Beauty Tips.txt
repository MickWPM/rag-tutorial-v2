Kaxon's Beauty Tips
Everything in Norrath will decay given time, but imagine how much more beautiful this
world would be if all things had the sight and aroma of rotting flesh. I have created
a few concoctions that will assist individuals gifted by Bertoxxulous with the visions
of the Dark Reflection.
Solvent Gangrene
This concoction creates a wonderful fungal rash on the flesh of the victim thus
slowly eating it away. In order to create it you must have a POISON VIAL, two bits
of GRAVE MOLD, and SUSPENSION.
Leprous Pus
In order to create a longer lasting rotting of the flesh. My second concoction requires
one BUNDLE OF WORMWOOD, one pinch of GRAVE MOLD, one bit of DARKBONE MARROW, a LINED
POISON VIAL and CONSTRICT SUSPENSION.
Visceral Rot
My final concoction is a favorite in the mines of malfunction. It causes the
longest lasting rotting of the flesh. The ingredients required are one pinch of
GRAVE MOLD, one bit of DARKBONE MARROW, WOOD ROSE, a SEALED POISON VIAL and LARENT SUSPENTION.
