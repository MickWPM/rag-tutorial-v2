Renux's Translations 

'I finished translating most 
of the first of the combine 
scrolls discovered by one of 
Carson McCabe's citizens. 
As I suspected, the scrolls 
contain recipes for several 
poisons from the age of the 
Combine Empire.
I have provided a brief
translation of those recipes.'
Poisons That Blind 
A blend of one part COYOTE TAIL
and one ASP POISON SACK
with LINED POISON VIAL
and SUSPENSION
will make an enemy's eyes grow
swollen and sore causing temporary blindness.
'A more painful and longer 

lasting blind poison is 

created with a bland of  
two parts COYOTE TAIL 
and a bit of MUDDITE MUD 
with a LINED POISON VIAL 
and CONSTRICT SUSPENSION'
