AKA "wort pot". This self-healing potion is important for end-game raiding guilds on difficult encounters where large amounts of damage are taken, or when the number of healers is lacking. Though expensive, repeated use of wort potions can keep a player alive through punishing area of effect spells and deadly flurries. Each wort pot can effectively extend a player's HP pool by 2700 if the last charge is saved for vendor recharge. Compare to Soulfire and Reaper of the Dead.
