  Book contents 
Nature's Beverages
Tunare has blessed us with fruits all over Norrath that
may be brewed into healthy and refreshing beverages.
Water may be distilled from the pods of certain plants.
Four pods of water may be distilled in a brew barrel to
fill one bottle.
A vast variety of fruits, berries, and leaves can be
found on flora throughout Norrath that make tasty
juices and teas. Two fruits, berries, or leaves and one
flask of water usually will produce plenty of juice to
quench one's thirst.
