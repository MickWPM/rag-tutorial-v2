Fish Fillets
This maritime menu is a Rohand classic. Nab the little nibblers anywhere
you find some water, and cook them up to a slimy perfection.
Ingredients: Fish and Jug of Sauces
Cooking Instructions: Set spit or oven for low heat. Barely allow fish
to come in contact with the heat, so as not to alter its perfect slimy
texture. Remove and top with sauces. Serve cold.
