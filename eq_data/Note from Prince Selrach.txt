  Book contents 
Father, I, as well as many of our council members,
do not feel comfortable with the power that has
been given to Korucust. This concern must be seen
as valid. Korucust has his expanded reach through
his use of terror and false accusations. I fail to see
the conspiracy that he keeps referring to and
caution you to reconsider giving him any more
power over our soldiers. Selrach
