This effect generates significant aggro for the user and absorbs a small amount of damage. It's often used as a cheaper form of Bladestopper to ensure a pull follows the intended player. This effect does not stack with many strength buffs.
Following the chardok revamp patch, it seems the hate from this clicky has been reduced to 41-116 per charge. (Please parse more to confirm an exact value).
