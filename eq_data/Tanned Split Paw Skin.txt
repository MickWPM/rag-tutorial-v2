  Book contents 
1
Fear not, my brethren! We have taken this home and we shall make it our own! Use what resources we have to establish ourselves here. Care not about the Theth, for they are our inferiors. Use their goods, use their services, and use their skins if need be. In time, we shall feel our former glory! Ishk kal hobra!

Tesch Val, you must recover, from the archives, the incantation to speed our transit to the new continent. Let not one of the council members see you, or you will surely be slain. You must complete this task I have laid before you, or they will eventually find and slay us. The accursed council knows of my location, so I must be off. Slay the messenger of this note when you have finished reading it. Good journey to you, my faithful. Ishva

Rosch Val, our plans have failed. We must escape this continent or risk being slain by the other elders on the council. My place upon the council was forfeit once it became known that I practiced the dark magiks. We must quicken our search for the maps. If we are unable to find the spell which will open the gate to Antonica, then we must acquire another means of travel. Ishva
