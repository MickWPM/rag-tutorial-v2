See thread about drops on P99.
Seems to have a drop rate of about 1 in 10 from undead in Mistmoore Castle. Given that the undead are only up for a bit less than half the day, this makes Essence of Moonlight annoyingly difficult to come by in any quantity. Soloing as a 50 cleric, I'm happy if I get two an hour, because oftentimes it's none.
