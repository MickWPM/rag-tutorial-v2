ITEM NAME: Ragebringer

To allow the assassin to slay a prince, and fight his way back out, a fell blade was crafted. 
It was small enough to conceal under a garment and yet large enough to strike a mortal blow through armor. 
Aided by vile Teir'Dal enchantments, it is much more fearsome than it appears.
