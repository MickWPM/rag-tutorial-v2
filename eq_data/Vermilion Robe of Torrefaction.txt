This item's clicky effect is a mid-level 625 damage fire nuke. With a 15 second cast time, it can put out 41.5 DPS. Compare to Solist's Robe of Invocation, Sage's Robe or Solist's Icy Wand. The Solist's Robe is higher dps, but the Vermilion Robe tends to land more reliably. Either robe is a great addition to any wizard's wardrobe!
