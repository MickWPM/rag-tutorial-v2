 Item Lore (from Identify): Dragon Stone of the Cobalt Scar
This item is found as a ground spawn inside the Dragon Ring in the Cobalt Scar at /loc (-1087, -1593, 296), a few hundred meters east of Skyshrine. It is required for the spells Circle of Cobalt Scar and Cobalt Scar Portal but not required for Translocate: Cobalt Scar. The caster as well as passengers must all possess the tooth in their bags or inventory for receiving the required spells; those who do not have the tooth are left behind. 
The Tooth of the Cobalt Scar is a "Master key" that allows you to port to Wakening Lands and Great Divide as well. Feel free to destroy your other teeth when you have this one.
Like the Trakanon Idol and Key to Charasis, this is a so-called soulbound item, which means it appears in your inventory after death and doesn't appear on your corpse.
