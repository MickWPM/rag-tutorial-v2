Rechargeable for about 18p(merchants buy for 2 and sell for 20). As of 4/19/2020[1] patch cost about 2100 to recharge. Now no longer instant cast as well.
These were the bread-and-butter aggro tools for warriors and monks alongside the LORE Midnight Mallet, before the nerfs in April 2020. 
Following the Chardok revamp patch, it seems the hate from this clicky has been reduced to 97-172 per charge. (Please parse more to confirm an exact value).
