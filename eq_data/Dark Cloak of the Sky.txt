Post-upgrade PoS quest reward. The effect is a 35% 50% haste buff similar to the monk epic except only haste. This is not usable by non-rangers from an inventory slot. Clicks from level 40 (source: Phirebolt's delevelled ranger). The Haste Effect was changed from 50% to 35% on P1999 on the Patch Tuesday, June 24th, 2014. https://www.project1999.com/forums/showthread.php?t=155457 "Haste (o) updated atk speed max 150 => 135" Appears to be 50% haste not 35%. See discussion for details.
