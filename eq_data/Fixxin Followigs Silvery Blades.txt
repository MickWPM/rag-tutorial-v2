Silvery Blades
Enchanted silver blades are a must for any would be monster hunter. A silver blade in the
gut is the quickest cure for lycanthropy and undeath.
Enchanted silver weapons must be forged from high quality ore that has been enchanted by a master enchanter such as
myself. A sheet of the enchanted ore must be melted down with an enchanted bar of silver into the appropriate
molds and tempered with a flask of water.
Weapons crafted in the manner described will be quick and deadly to any supernatural beast in the hands of a skilled warrior.
May lycanthropes everywhere tremble in fear from the glistening of silver blades under the light of the full moon!!
