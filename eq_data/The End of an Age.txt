  Book contents 
Friend, Know this. At the end of the Combine Era, after Tsaph Katta had died,
Seru sent his minions out to renew his Inquisition. This brought great torment
and wailing to many. The Inquisition was dispersed when they attacked
the Circle of Light. Although the battle left no survivors, the Circle of
Light succeeded in holding back the enemy while their loved ones fled. Out of
respect, the enchanters' descendants divided their Tomes, so all could have
proof of their exaltation. We must not forget the great Tasarian, Velishoul
and other Circle members. Honor them by reassembling their tomes!
Try to find sections of the enchanters' tomes to piece together an entire spell.
Some of the pages may be faded but with careful research they can be
restored to their prior glory.
It is rumored that some spells were so large that they had to span two or more pages.
