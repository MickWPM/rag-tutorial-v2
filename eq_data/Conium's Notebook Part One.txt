Conium's Notebook One
Nubs Came to Visit.
My old friend Nubs returned
from his journey to the Lava-
storm Mountains, his hands
still stained red with the
blood of the goblins native
to those lands. Among his bag
of trophies I found a strange
black fungus. Nubs calls it a
DEATH CAP due to a white
vaguely skull-shaped marking
adorning the cap. Nubs tells
me they are grown by kobolds
who live in the volcano of
Solusek's Eye, and that two,
combined with BLACK HENBANE,
also grown by the kobolds,
create a poison that numbs a
person's mind so that they are
oblivious to actions around
them. Be sure to have a SEALED
POISON VIAL and LARENT
SUSPENSION for storage. Heh,
Nubs says the kobold shamans
ingest it themselves in prayer
to their god.

A Really Angry Goblin.
I had just returned from the
Lesser Faydarks where I had
gone to collect some PIXIE
DUST so that I may experiment
with the rumor that the dust
can sometimes drive a person
crazy. Upon opening my pack I
discovered that the dust had
spilt and now coated the
AMANITA PHALLOIDE fungi I had
collected from the rotten
mulch that passes for a lawn
in the Estate of Unrest.
Thinking my pixie dust wasted
I went ahead and prepared the
fungi in the usual manner
with a SEALED POISON VIAL and
LARENT SUSPENSION and set out
to hunt goblins. I found me a
goblin all right and boy was
I surprised when the fungi
poison I had coated my blades
with made him go berserk.
I've never seen a goblin
fight so desperately in all my
years slaying the vermin.
Fortunately the ugly critter
dropped dead within minutes
of the poison taking effect.
