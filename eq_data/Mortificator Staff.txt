Vendors for 15p. Although not very impressive for use in grouping or soloing, especially early on, it can be invaluable in certain instances where there are no Enchanters to sieve a CH or gate raid target.  Good damage ratios make this a serviceable shaman weapon at early levels for added dps, but the proc effect is useless against just about any mob as they're likely to be dead five times over by the time you can land enough procs to prevent them from CH-ing or gating. While it can be resisted, after Malo, several shamans using them in succession can successfully prevent mobs from gating or at a minimum reduce the number of CHs west waste dragons will perform.Also worth mention is that besides the Staff of Discord and Withered Totem of Widdershins, this is the only Shaman exclusive weapon that uses this item model; very fashionable.
