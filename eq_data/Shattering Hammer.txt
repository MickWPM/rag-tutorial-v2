Stackable. Summoned by Bracer of Hammerfal. Allows CLR, DRU, SHM, PAL, SHD, classes that don't normally have a throwing skill to level up throwing... to 275.[1] This value is not shown in the skills menu though.[2] However, the skill going up from 1 to 275 does seem to significantly impact accuracy and damage. Notably these hammers are rentable (not NO RENT) and will persist in your inventory through play sessions.
