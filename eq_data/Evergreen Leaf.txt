Evergreen Leaf


WT: 0.1  Size: TINY
Class: ALL
Race: ALL


Used to make "green" color dyes for Fine Plate Armor. Ground spawn in Greater Faydark.
Went looking for these today and found nine scattered throughout the Kelethin newbie area (the ruined druid circle). Look around the bases of the trees to find them, as every second or third tree had one. I'm not sure what the respawn timer is, but it's longer than ten minutes.
Some (but probably not all) confirmed locations:  

 (-402, -55)
 (286, -367)
 (65, 162)
 (395, -436)
 (150, -380)
 (506, -631)
