It reads,

Another fool doth step upon this path to power. Another fool most assuredly will die.
It is of no consequence if you succeed or fail, the outcome is yours to decide.
What is needed from you is to stalk the land as the dark master you wish to be,
and obtain the following components through stealth, guile, and deceit:
An assassins Bloody mantle, a druid of renown's pure heart, and a crystal of capturing.
When done, place them within the enchanted soul trap and incant upon them that they may be combined.
If you have not failed miserably, take the resulting Soul Trap to the soul you wish to manipulate.
