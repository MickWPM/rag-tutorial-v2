Heals the user for up to several hundred HP and slows their melee attacks by 10% for 5 minutes. The slow can be cured with several casts of Abolish Poison. Edit: the previous trivia, though fascinating, is irrelevant. This heal is classified as a beneficial spell, so after using the potion the slow can simply be clicked off. No need for poison abolishment.
