ITEM NAME: Shark Skin

Classic Era (added 1999-2000)Were you looking for Heretic Shark Skin?

Shark Skin


WT: 0.1  Size: SMALL
Class: ALL
Race: ALL


Notes: In OoT, both reef and normal sharks go between sisters isle and the goblin island across from the dock. I recommmend sitting on the banks of the goblin island and waiting for sharks to pass by from the northernmost point. In Erud's Crossing, many sharks can be found off the west coast of the island (farther off from the sunken ship), as well as three stationary spawns by the sunken ship. However, the best place to farm these is at the Erudin docks: several spawns of a shark and a sand shark (the latter of which drops skin more often) are found near the docks, and when you manage to spawn a diseased shark and kill it, eight a young sharks will spawn, each of which can drop skins.

Alternatively you can just camp named sharks in Kedge Keep.  By the time you get a few rare items (especially if you go for a super rare item like the Driftwood Treasure ChestDriftwood Treasure Chest


WT: 10.0  Weight Reduction: 100%
