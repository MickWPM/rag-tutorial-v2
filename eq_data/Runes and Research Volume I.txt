  Book contents 
The Researchers Guide To Practice Runes
compiled by The Arch-Mage of Norrath

The making of Runes is a delicate matter.
It is not just one of your researching games
While at first you might doubt The might of my arts
I tell you that a rune Must have two separate parts.

With apologies to the Master Cat Bard

Practice Runes, not to be confused with Wizard Research
Runes, are used by Magi who wish to gain skill in research
without the pressure of practicing on real research components.

There are eight types of practice runes, and two runes
of each type - Azia and Beza. Azia and Beza runes can be
constructed by combining specific components in a
Concordance of Research. There is no skill required for
this - the Magic of the Concordance is responsible
for the transmutation of the components into Azia and Beza Runes.

Once the Azia and Beza Runes have been acquired, the Magi
may practice her research by combining these Runes in her
appropriate research book - a Lexicon for a Wizard, a Book
of Dark Bindings for a Necromancer, etc.

All Runes require a Quill and a piece of Parchment, as well as
other specified components.

The end.
