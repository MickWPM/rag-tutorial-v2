 Item Lore (from Identify):  'Dragon Stone of the Great Divide'  
This item is found as a ground spawn inside the Dragon Ring in Great Divide. It is required for the spells Circle of Great Divide and Great Divide Portal. The caster as well as passengers must all possess the tooth in their bags or inventory; those who do not have it are left behind. 
The Tooth of the Wakening Lands will also work for Great Divide teleportation; and the Tooth of the Cobalt Scar will work for all three. Feel free to destroy this tooth if you get either of the others.
Like the Trakanon Idol and Key to Charasis, this is a so-called soulbound item, which means it appears in your inventory after death.
