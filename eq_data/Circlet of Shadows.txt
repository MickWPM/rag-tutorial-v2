NOTE: Since the auction tracker seems to be broken for this item currently, a rough approximate price for this item (based on actions seen in August 2017) would be 300-400 plat. Feb. 2018 update: 200-300pp June 2022 update: 100-200pp (Funny how increased drop rates will make item values plummet making once rare and highly sought after items now common and worthless.  I had 3 of these rot while I was camping the spawns area for a few hours...)
