On 6/24/19 in The Feerrott at Fishing skill 125 I used 1 Fishing Pole and 60 Fishing Grubs to catch 19 Rusty Dagger, 14 Fish Scales, 12 Fresh Fish, 11 Tattered Cloth Sandal, & 5 Thullian Mudskipper. Also confirmed Filleting Knife cannot be made with Blacksmithing Skill on P99, therefore Prepared Fish cannot be made with Baking Skill, therefore this fish can only be eaten as it is.
