  Book contents 
Keeper of the House's log
1. New wash basins must be acquired. Servant Hujin will see the Quartermaster and
place the order tomorrow.
2. The chandelier in the main hall was finally repaired tonight. Payment must be sent
to the contract holder tomorrow.
3. Advisor Snith ordered that I personally find and acquire 3 dozen finely made vials.
What they are for he would not explain and was very firm that I do this as quickly
as possible. Best to make haste to fulfill the order, rumors abound of the Advisor's
mastery of the arcane.
4. We've been low on candles for the last week. There is no explanation for the shortage
of wax says our civilian contract holder. Perhaps I should send a Palace Reaver escort with
the next pick up crew. The craftsman may have the intelligence to figure the symbolism.
5. It is imperative that we return the High Scale's Icon to the church as discretely
as possible. If Rak Ashiir returns from his journey early and discovers it was found
in the royal bedroom it may prove disastrous. I cannot decide whether to place it
ourselves with help of our Black Guard, or to approach one of our contacts in the
church. The less people that know of this the better. It might be prudent to ..remove..
the servant who found it within the sheets.
