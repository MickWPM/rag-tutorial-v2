  Book contents 
Since you have not the money you owe me, I have thought of a little, shall we say, a little deal.  I have decided to let you work off your debt to me. . .as you have nothing of value for me to take anyway.  Return this note to me, and we shall work out the details of your service.       - Welno Tanboots
