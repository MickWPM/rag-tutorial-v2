  Book contents 
A FIELD GUIDE TO FLETCHING: THIRD EDITION
Fletching, the art of making arrows from component pieces,
is one of the oldest weapon crafts on Norrath.
This tome details the construction of arrows, as
well as providing information on the sister craft of the Bowyer.
Bowyers and Fletchers both require Fletching Kits to practice their trades.
Fletching kits can be purchased from archery shops.
ARROWS
There are four parts to every arrow.
Generally, the cheaper the part, the easier it is to assemble.
Expensive components produce superior arrows.
1. NOCK
There are three types of nocks, differentiated by the
size of their grooves. The larger the groove, the easier
the arrow is to make. The smaller the groove, the
farther the arrow travels.
2. SHAFT
The shaft of the arrow can be made from a variety of
different materials. The most common material used for
shafts is wood. Bone shafts are stronger than wood, and
Porcelain stronger than Bone.
Steel is the strongest material used for arrow shafts.
3. TIP
There are many designs for arrow tips. The most common
is the point tipped arrow. Slightly more damaging is the
hooked tip - its small blades cause tearing and
bleeding. Actual bladed arrows do more damage than the
hook tipped arrows, though they are easier to remove.
4. FLETCH
The fletch, or feathering, of the arrow influences the
distance the arrow travels, as well as the impact
delivered upon a successful hit.
The easiest pattern to fletch is a round cut.
Slightly more difficult is the parabolic cut, whose spin
gives the arrow additional flight range.
The shield cut fletch pattern has a shorter range than
either the round or the parabolic cut, but produces
a spin providing superior armor penetration.
RESTRINGING BOWS
The strings of bows are interchangable and various
strings will provide greater range, damage, or quickness.
