Jack-O-Lantern Fungus

Used to make "yellow" color dyes for Fine Plate Armor.
Ground spawn in the Lesser Faydark faerie, pixie, and brownie camps (need locs) (1156, 3614), (1116, 3629). It seems that when you pick it up, it respawns at one of the other spawn locs, meaning you would need all of them to properly farm it.
Also a group spawn in Unrest around the Gazebo area.
