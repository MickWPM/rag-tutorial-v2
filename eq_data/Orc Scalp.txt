ITEM NAME: Orc Scalp

Classic Era (added 1999-2000)

Orc Scalp


WT: 0.1  Size: SMALL
Class: ALL
Race: ALL


Dec 18 2011 Patch: "orc scalps no longer drop all over norrath. They drop in and around the Deathfist areas." 40 Scalps will give a Gnome Wizard 100% of level 16. 21 scalps will give a high elf Enchanter 100% of 12.
Green/Teal: Because of the increased spawn rate of mobs on these servers, these scalps reward significantly less XP than they otherwise would.
