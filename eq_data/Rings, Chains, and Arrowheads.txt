Rings, Chains, and Arrowheads by Gord Smith
When times are hard it is wise for a blacksmith to forge small items that are used by other craftsmen.
Some of the more profitable forged supplies are metal rings, chain jointing, arrow-heads, steel shafts, and skinning knives.
WATER FLASKS and a FORGE are of course required to forge any of these items.
METAL RINGS must be carefully shaped out of a LARGE BRICK OF ORE with a FILE.
The METAL RINGS can then be joined together into CHAIN JOINTING with a FILE and SMITHY HAMMER.
Chain jointing is used by skilled blacksmithing in the crafting of Field Plate and Full Plate armors.
FIELD ARROWHEADS can be easily shaped from METAL BITS with a FILE.
HOOKED ARROWHEADS must be crafted with a FILE and THREE SMALL BRICKS of ORE.
SILVER TIPPED ARROWHEADS are very desirable by fletchers but require a SILVER BAR in addition to a FILE and a BLOCK of MEDIUM QUALITY ORE.
Another smithed item in demand by fletchers are STEEL ARROWSHAFTS which can be smithed using a FILE and TWO LARGE BRICKS of MEDIUM QUALITY ORE.
SKINNING KNIVES are a favorite tool for tailors who specialize in hides and leathers. 
A skinning knife can be crafted with a DAGGER BLADE MOLD, a SMALL BRICK OF ORE, and a HILT MOLD.
Happy smithing and may your coin purse never go hungry!
The End.
