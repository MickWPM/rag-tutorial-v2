The Art of Idol Sculpting An Idol of a Deity is a valuable instrument of worship that can grant the favor of the Gods. In order to craft such an Idol one will have to acquire an Idol Sketch, a Large Block of Magic Clay, a Vial of Clear Mana, Sculpting Tools, and an Imbued Gem of the appropriate Deity. Once the Idol is sculpted on the Pottery Wheel it must be glazed and fired in a Kiln. This process will require a High Quality Firing Sheet , the Unfired Idol, and Divine Crystalline Glaze. The Glaze is composed of White Lead, Iron Oxide, Permafrost Crystals, and Water.
