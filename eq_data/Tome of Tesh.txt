  Book contents 
The 10 Coins of Tash

The Enchanter Tash
Had ten Silver Coins
They now lie scattered
Across the world
In cities old
These coins do gleam
Waiting still
To be claimed

One lies
In the city of Darkness
Where the blind fish stares

One lies
In the city of Divided
Where the building floats

One lies
In the city of Ice
Where the water cools

One lies
In the city of Law
Where the temple floats

One lies
In the city of Light
Where the water ends

One lies
In the city of Magic
Where the water spouts

One lies
In the city of Metal
Where the water falls

One lies
In the city of Stone
Where the water sits

One lies
In the city of Swamp
Where the ale flows

One lies
In the city of War
Where the water boils

The end.
