  Book contents 
Written in Lizardman:

The list should all be in order except for the swatches of silk. I won't need such a large order in this quarter.
Her Divinity Drian made it known to me that they would not need as many new robes this coming season as "none were quite ready to don them."
My colleagues have all been confirming that the church is buying less and less these days.
It seems Rak Ashiir has decided the royal donation to be cut. However I'm sure we'll find new customers soon and our orders will be back to normal shortly.
