  Book contents 
Written in Lizardman:
Hear all Torsis! It is with great regret that we inform you of our Queen, Neh
Ashiir's disappearance. Our best scouts have begun searching the surrounding countries for her trail. The Lord Rak
Ashiir also authorized the hire of mercenaries to venture into the Froglok Territories to search for traces of the Queen. All interested parties should report to the royal Quartermaster's office. Fear not citizens, our Queen will be found. Wisdom guide us.
