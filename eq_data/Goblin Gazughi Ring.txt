I camped 8 rings over this holiday season over the course of 224 kills of a sarnak courier for a rate of 3.5%. There is an extreme amount of variability here with the first 3 rings coming in 18 kills and ring 5 taking 67 kills. Good luck on the grind! - Beckoning

Over 15 days at 2-3 hour increments I killed 241 couriers before my first ring drop. This was all at the two double spawn points. - Comorbidity (Green 11/21/23)
