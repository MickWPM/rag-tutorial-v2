New version of the Guise of the Deceiver. 
A rogue level 10 (I did this with a Level 5 Rogue today Dec 2, 2019) or above can hide/sneak undetected up to the ass/sup room. Therefore if someone is leaving a Mask of Deception to rot your rogue should be able to get there and loot it. [1]
Be aware that the assassin can see through hide, unlike most other mobs in the area. Always /consider mobs on the way for safety. The minimum level to zone into Lower Guk is 5.
Drops on green as of May/1/2020.
Note: Unlike the Guise of the Deceiver, this item can only be used by the classes that can wear it, even from inventory.
