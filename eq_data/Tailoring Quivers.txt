  Book contents 
Many archers prefer to craft their own quivers.
The simplest of hand crafted quivers can be made in a
tailoring kit with a High Quality Cat Pelt and a Quiver
Pattern. There have been archers who have developed more personal
quivers usually for the sake of style, but it is not my
place to reveal their secrets
FLEETING QUIVER
The fleeting quiver is an enchanted quiver that allows
arrows to be drawn very quickly.
To craft a Fleeting Quiver you must obtain a Fleeting Quiver
Pattern, Aviak Egg Oil, a High Quality Lion Skin, a Vial of
Distilled Mana, and Griffon Feathers.
