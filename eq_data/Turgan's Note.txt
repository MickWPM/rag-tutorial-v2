  Book contents 
I have failed. Try as I might I had not the power to revive my brothers caught in this horrible fire.
I have left the Ingot of the Reliant hidden on one of the stumps in a ring here in Kithicor. One can jump from
a fallen log in the middle of the ring to get to it with little effort. I will now take leave of this place and 
try to put the travesty out of my mind. Perhaps the shores of Lake Rathe will help ease my pain, but I fear
even that tranquility will afford me no peace.
Sincerely,
Turgan the Reliant
