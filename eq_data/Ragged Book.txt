 The Penance 

  Book contents 
The will of Cazic Thule is Strong.
The route to Cazic Thule is through the strength of the Brood.
The Brood is the living instrument of Cazic Thule.
This is the will of Cazic Thule.

Your lack of discipline is an assault on the well being of the Brood.
You have shown weakness in your inability to fulfill your destiny as a member of the Brood.

You have defied the will of Cazic Thule.
Your fate will be decided by the grace of Cazic Thule.
Please prepare yourself.

Your weakness warrants your destruction.
Only our belief in your ability to reclaim your place as a member of the Brood, a seed of Cazic Thule, keeps you from that destruction at this time.

You will be allowed to pay a penance for your defiance of the destiny that Cazic Thule has chosen for you.
Please find the Toilmaster when you are prepared to begin your penance.

May Cazic Thule find a use for your wretched flesh and allow you to continue on.
