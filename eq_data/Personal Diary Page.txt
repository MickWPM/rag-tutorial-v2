  Book contents 
I heard last night that there was some kind of commotion at the castle. Guards were shouting, spells went off throughout the halls and many died.
Some say there was an assassination, some say a band of frogloks attacked under the command of a dragon, some even say there was some divine intervention.
I have no idea why any god would strike against Lord Rak Ashiir. He is a paragon for the cause of Cazic-Thule.
I hope whatever it was sticks to attacking the castle and not my shop though.
