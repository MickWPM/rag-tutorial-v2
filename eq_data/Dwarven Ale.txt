ITEM NAME: Dwarven Ale

Classic Era (added 1999-2000)
Ahhh.. Dwarven ale is the best. You gotta hand it to those stinky little dirt diggers, they know how to make a good brew. 
Now if they could just learn to shower, huh, Harkin? Ha ha ha!

Strangely, this item cannot be produced by players (even dwarves) via any known recipes, but is only vendor-purchased. Perhaps the recipe is a closely controlled secret in dwarven society.
