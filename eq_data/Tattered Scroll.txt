  Book contents 
Within the tower lies the corpse of Mirgon Dower. A faithful servant of Kurn's deadly tower.
He served Kurn and kept him very well fed. Now it is time to replace his head.
His new head did glow once upon a time. Now there are no eyes, no tongue, to taste the sweet crunchy flesh.
And so the years flow. When all are back together the magic will once again glow.
The end.
