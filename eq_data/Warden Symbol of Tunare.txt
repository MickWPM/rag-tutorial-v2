Easily one of the most useful clickie items I've used as a druid. Saved me numerous times being able to continuously root mobs. Of course it's a short duration, and the root at times has broken quickly, but I've found myself out of mana with the last bit of life left in a mob and either spammed the root until they die or kept them parked while I regen enough mana to get off the final nuke or DoT. Totally worth the annoyance of tracking down ghasts or waiting for that stupid necromancer to spawn in LFaydark!
