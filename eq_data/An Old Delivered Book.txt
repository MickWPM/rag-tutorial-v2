  Book contents 
Vidlos, 
As promised, I aquired the information you wanted. I am hated in my own land now and you will compensate me for it. The information is as follows: 
There are many poisons that do not need to be made. Examples are the Vial of Rabid Froth and the Crook-Stinger Poison. 
To make poisons use the mortar and pestle. 
Before battle apply the pioson to a piercing weapon.
