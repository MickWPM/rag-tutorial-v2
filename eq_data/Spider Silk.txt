Spider silk (and the refined Silk Swatch) are valued by journeyman tailors looking to increase their skill. It's especially efficient to farm these in Field of Bone, East Karana and anywhere else large numbers of spiders (not spiderlings) can be found.
Not to be confused with Spiderling Silk harvested from the weaker a spiderling.
