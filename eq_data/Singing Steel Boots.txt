The clicky version of this song lasts just under 5 minutes (seems to be 1 tick less than 5 minutes, in limited testing, lev dropped between 4m55s and 4m58s, but definitely varied between castings). Works with target group buff once that era is reached. Formerly, Summon Food was the effect. Summon Drink is the initial effect on green server.
