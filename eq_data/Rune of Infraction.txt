Rune of Infraction

As this rune is used for crafting a useful spell that cannot be vendor-purchased, it is advised to save this rune to sell or give to other players.  This rune is used along with Rune of Al'Kabor and Rune of the Helix to create Force Spiral of Al'Kabor.  Since the Al'Kabor line is not considered usable, this spell is not important beyond completing your spellbook.
