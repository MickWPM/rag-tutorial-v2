  Book contents 
Beer Braised Lion
Don't be put off by the fact that this meat is tender and juicy. The flavor can be greatly enhanced if you allow lion meat to rot awhile before cooking.
Ingredients: Lion Meat, Spices, Short Beer
Cooking instructions: Fire a spit or oven. Delicately brush beer across the surface of the
meat following the grain. Dredge in spices and grill. Continue adding beer until meat is golden in color. Serve medium-rare.
Tastes great with: Berry Pie and Short Beer
Mammoth Steaks
Huge steaks with huge flavor. These juicy steaks are a treat for the hunter who can bring down the beast.
Ingredients: Mammoth Meat, Spices, Jug of Sauces
Cooking instructions: Fire a spit or oven for maximum heat. Remove fat to minimize spitting, and
season generously. Add sauces and grill. Stand back when meat crackles and sputters. Eat when the meat falls from bone.
Tastes great with: Candied Spider and Ale
Pickled Gator
Taste this tongue-twister! Sour and bubbly meets hot and rubbery. It confuses
the taste buds just long enough for you to grab some Bog Juice and put out the fire.
Ingredients: Alligator Meat, Vinegar
Cooking Instructions: Dump gator chunklets into a jar, allowing space for
bubbling. Quickly pour in enough vinegar to cover chunks, but quickly cover
to reduce the chance of explosion. Eat when bubbles have stabilized.
Tastes great with: Rat Ear Pie and Bog Juice
Rabbit Stew
If you catch one of these rascals while picking produce, just toss him into a pot for an easy entree.
Ingredients: Rabbit, Flask of Water, 1 Pot
Cooking Instructions: Drop rabbit bits into a pot of boiling water. When meat is tender, remove from heat and serve.
Tastes great with: Snake on a Stick and Ale
