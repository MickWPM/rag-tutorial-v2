Post-upgrade PoS quest reward. Replaces Transparent Mask and initially has the same targeted Invisibility effect with unlimited charges, but is later retroactively nerfed sometime in Velious to self-only Gather Shadows with a cast time. Like many other PoS quest rewards, rather than upgrade the Transparent Mask, a player can additionally quest an entire Crystal Mask separately and then have both items. Once the Crystal Mask is nerfed to self-only, this allows the player to continue to use the Transparent Mask for instant targetable invis.
